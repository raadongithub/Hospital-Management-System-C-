# Hospital Management System C++ using DSA
This C++ program implements a simple hospital management system using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes functionalities to add patients, delete patients, search for patients by name, display the patient list, change patient names, and insert new patients at the front of the list. <br>
## Functionality:
<br>
Add Patient: Allows users to input details of a new patient and adds them to the hospital database.<br>
Delete Patient: Permits the removal of a patient from the database by specifying their location.<br>
Search by Name: Enables users to search for a patient by their name and displays their details if found.<br>
List Length: Shows the total number of patients currently registered in the hospital.<br>
Print List: Displays the details of all patients in the database.<br>
Change Patient Name: Allows users to update the name of a patient in the database.<br>
Insert New at Front: Adds a new patient to the beginning of the patient list.<br>
## Potential Failures:

The program might terminate unexpectedly if insufficient patients are present in the database during deletion.<br>
Input errors could occur if the user enters invalid data types or formats during patient registration.
